# Summary
The goal of this project is to Predict the total number of Washington D.C. bicycle users on an hourly basis using a dataset (use attached `hour.csv`, and have a look at `csv description.txt` for explanations)
 with data from 2011 and 2012. The notebook shold be divided in the following sections:

### Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Ensuring data quality
2. Plotting clear and meaningful figures
3. Checking possibly redundant variables via correlations
4. Giving insights on what seems relevant for prediction and what does not

### Part 2: Data Engineering
1. Discussion on missing values and outliers
2. Treatment of text and date features
3. Generation of extra features and studying the influence of combinations of features
4. Giving new insights on what seems relevant for prediction and what does not
5. Use of scikit-learn pipelines to perform transformations

### Part 3: Machine Learning
1. Choosing sensible models (linear and non-linear)
    * Baseline Linear Regression with Initial Variables
    * Linear Regression with New Variables
    * Baseline Random Forest
2. Tuning model parameters with validation
3. Obtaining accurate predictions in test
4. Plotting predictions vs reality for additional insights
